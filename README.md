# Hello 👋🏻, I'm Andrei-Daniel Petrica, 
### Please call me Daniel.
I'm a software developer focusing on web technologies.

I created my first Git repo in 2016 and since then I've never stopped exploring and experiencing with computers and programming.

Currently, working for WarrantHub in Correggio, Italy.

I usually code in PHP, JS and I store data with SQL databases (mainly MySQL) and rarely NoSQL ones too. 

I tend to prefer TypeScript and Vue3 when possible.

I occasionally publish photos on Unsplash, here's my profile: https://unsplash.com/@danielpetrica

I have a remoteok profile, see it here [https://remoteok.com/@danielpetrica](https://remoteok.com/@danielpetrica)

My long time dream is to move to Japan :japan: :jp:  , so I can accept a job proposal helping me to get there.

I have a thing called [Dysorthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysorthography), so if you find any typo please signal it to me.
