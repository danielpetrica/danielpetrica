# Hello 👋🏻, I'm Andrei-Daniel Petrica

#### Please call me Daniel.
I'm a software developer focusing on web technologies.

I have a profile on the Fediverse, connect with me at <a rel="me" href="https://infosec.exchange/@danielpetrica">https://infosec.exchange/@danielpetrica</a>

I created my first Git repo in 2016 and since then I've never stopped exploring and experiencing with computers and programming.

## Work 


I usually code in PHP, JS and I store data with SQL databases (mainly MySQL) and rarely NoSQL ones too. 

I tend to prefer TypeScript and Vue.js for frontends and Laravel for backedn development.

## Personal stuff

My long time dream is to move to Japan :japan:, so I can accept a job proposal helping me to get there.

I have a thing called [Dysorthography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysorthography), so if you find any typo please signal it to me.
