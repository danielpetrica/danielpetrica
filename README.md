I have a profile on the Fediverse, connect with me at <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.grozav.dev/@pad">https://mastodon.grozav.dev/@pad</a>

I created my first Git repo in 2016 and since then I've never stopped exploring and experiencing with computers and programming.

## Work 

Currently, working for WarrantHub in Correggio, Italy.

I usually code in PHP, JS and I store data with SQL databases (mainly MySQL) and rarely NoSQL ones too.¬†

I tend to prefer TypeScript and Vue3 when possible.¬†
