# Hello 👋🏻, I'm Andrei-Daniel Petrica, 
##### Please call me Daniel. 

I'm a software developer focusing on web technologies. 


I created my first Git repo in 2016 and since then I've never stopped 
exploring and experiencing with computers and programming.  


Currently, working for WarrantHub in Correggio, Italy.
