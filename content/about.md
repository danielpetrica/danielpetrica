Full stack developer coding with web technologies like  Laravel, Vue.js and Sql. 

Based in Reggio Emilia, Italy 

Nerdy on the inside I'm driven by curiosity, and the need to continuously learn new things.

Currently, employed at [Mow.it](https://mow.it).

Worked for [Timeneye.com](https://Timeneye.com) 
and [Saleswith.it](https://saleswith.it) as a full stack web
 developer taking care of all sides of web development, from the server 
 and database infrastructure to the frontend development. 
 
 Some skills and technologies on my toolkit are: 
 - Git

I occasionally build open source projects, you can discover them on my
